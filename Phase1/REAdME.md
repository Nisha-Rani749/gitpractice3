 Pattern 1 
 Pattern 2

Lab2:- 
Write a Function that accepts the range to Find Odd Numbers between the input range.

Lab3:-
Write a Function which prints the sum of 1-N numbers when N is input.[n(n+1)/2].

Lab4:-
Write an Algorithm to computer x^y using WHILE loop where x and y are Function input parameters.

Lab5:- 
Print N Fibonacci numbers in one line where is N is a function input parameter.

Lab6:-
Write an Algorithm to validate the given input Number N is Prime or Not. 

Lab7:-
Write an algorithm(Function) that receives an input string.

Lab8:-
Write an algorithm to Split the Input String into two strings based on even and odd indexes. Left padd '000' string and right pad with '111' string.

Test case:

Input: 
code.in 
Output : 
000cd.n111
000oei111

Lab9:-
Write a function that creates Even array elements which accepts N is input. Push N to Even Array if the N is even number.

Lab10:-
Represent the below matrices as group of rows once and group of cols using Multi Dimensional Arrays and implement the addition of the matrices.
    i) Add 2 matrices size 4x4
   ii) Add 2 matrices size 3x3
  iii) Add 2 matrices size 2x3
   iv) Add 2 matrices size 3x2

Lab11:-)
Split the array and add the first part to the end. There is a given array and split it from a specified position, and move the first part of array add to the end.Write a function that accepts an array and index position to split as arguments.

Test case: 
Input: 
arr= [12, 10, 5, 6, 52, 36], index position to split = 2
Output : [5, 6, 52, 36, 12, 10]

Lab12:-
Write a program to calculate trailing zeros count for factorial of a given input N Number.
